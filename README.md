# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this analysis is to identify the number of retiring employees at Pewlett-Hackard. I'll be identifying the employees
that are retiring by their job title so Pewlett-Hackard can know what spots and job positions they can fill. 
I waill also be helping Pewlett-Hackard also identify their employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 


## Results
- In order to get the retirement title I had to create a table This the syntax I used to create the table and I also imported that table under [retirement_titles](https://github.com/justinamaze/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/retirement_titles.csv)

used to get my output

positions by jobe title. 

* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? Yes
